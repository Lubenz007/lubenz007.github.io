# BensiEgils Blog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Preservation
All existing blog posts, metadata, and structure MUST be preserved during the Jekyll to Hugo migration. Content integrity is non-negotiable - no posts, images, or metadata may be lost in the conversion process.

**Rationale**: The blog contains valuable technical content documenting various projects and tutorials that must remain accessible to readers.

### II. Visual Consistency
The Hugo site MUST maintain the same visual appearance and user experience as the current Jekyll Chirpy theme. Layout, styling, navigation, and responsive design must be functionally equivalent.

**Rationale**: Users expect consistent branding and navigation experience. Breaking visual consistency would harm user experience and brand recognition.

### III. Performance First
The Hugo site MUST deliver equal or better performance compared to the Jekyll version. This includes build times, page load speeds, and resource optimization.

**Rationale**: Hugo's primary advantage over Jekyll is performance. The migration must realize these benefits while maintaining all existing functionality.

### IV. SEO Preservation
All SEO elements including URLs, meta tags, structured data, and search engine optimization features MUST be preserved or improved in the Hugo version.

**Rationale**: Existing search rankings and discoverability must not be compromised during the migration.

### V. Automation Compatibility
The Hugo site MUST integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub Actions workflows for deployment, testing, and content validation.

**Rationale**: Automated workflows reduce maintenance burden and ensure consistent quality. Breaking automation would increase operational overhead.

## Technical Standards

Hugo site must implement:
- Static site generation with equivalent build pipeline
- Theme system compatible with Chirpy design principles
- Markdown content processing with front matter support
- Image optimization and asset management
- RSS/Atom feed generation
- Sitemap and robots.txt generation
- Analytics and tracking integration

## Migration Workflow

All changes must follow this process:
1. Create Hugo site structure while preserving Jekyll content
2. Port Chirpy theme styling to Hugo theme format  
3. Migrate all posts with metadata validation
4. Update GitHub Actions workflow for Hugo deployment
5. Perform side-by-side comparison testing
6. Implement redirect handling for URL compatibility

## Governance

This constitution governs the Jekyll to Hugo migration project. All implementation decisions must align with the core principles. Any deviation requires explicit justification and documentation of impact.

Migration success criteria:
- All existing content accessible via identical URLs
- Visual parity with current Jekyll site
- Improved or equivalent performance metrics
- Successful automated deployment pipeline
