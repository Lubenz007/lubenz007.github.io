### Need to keep track of your Azure usage? here is a way to use github actions to keep track of your usage. And send you a Teams message if you are over a certain amount.

> We will need to enable webhook in Teams and add the webhook to the script, and create a Service Principal with access to the subscription you want to monitor.
{: .prompt-tip }

Create Service Principal and give it access to the subscription you want to monitor.
Copy the output from the command below and add it to the github repository as a secret, AZURE_CREDENTIALS.
```powershell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "AzureUsage" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/0692777c --sdk-auth
```
