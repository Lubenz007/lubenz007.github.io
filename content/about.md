# About Me

## IT Professional with 25+ Years Experience

My background is in virtualization and IT administration, with a strong focus on system administration. Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of various technologies, including:

- **Windows** - System administration and management
- **Hyper-V & VMware** - Virtualization technologies  
- **Linux** - Server administration
- **Datacenter** - Infrastructure management
- **Azure Cloud** - Cloud computing and services

I have a strong focus on automation and scripting, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

This blog is where I store my knowledge to look back on and share with others.
