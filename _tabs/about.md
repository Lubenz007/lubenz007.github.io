# IT professional with over 25 years of experience in the industry. 

My background is in virtualization and IT administration, with a strong focus on system administration. Over the years, I have developed a deep understanding of various technologies, including Windows, Hyper-v, Vmware, (Linux), datacenter, and Azure cloud. I have a strong focus on automation and scripting, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

This blog is where I store my knowledge to look back on and share with others. You dont get to be 50 without learning a thing or two.
