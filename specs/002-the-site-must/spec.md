## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a blog visitor, I want to experience the same visual design, navigation structure, and functionality when the site migrates from Jekyll to Hugo, so that my browsing experience remains consistent and familiar.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor accessing the Hugo site, **When** they view the homepage, **Then** they see the same visual layout, logo placement, and design elements as the original Jekyll Chirpy theme
2. **Given** a visitor browsing the site, **When** they navigate using the left sidebar menu, **Then** they can access all the same categories that existed in the Jekyll version
3. **Given** a visitor viewing blog posts, **When** they look at post content, **Then** all images and media assets display correctly in their intended locations
4. **Given** a visitor preferring dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme option, **Then** the site switches to a dark theme that matches the Chirpy aesthetic
5. **Given** a visitor accessing the About page, **When** they view the content, **Then** they see the same information and layout as the original Jekyll site

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a visitor has bookmarked a specific category URL from the Jekyll site?
- How does the system handle visitors accessing the site during the migration window?
- What happens if a visitor tries to access the site with theme preferences cached from the Jekyll version?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the same visual design and layout as the original Jekyll Chirpy theme
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a left sidebar navigation menu with tree-like category organization
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain all existing blog categories from the Jekyll site
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the same logo and branding elements in identical positions
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide dark theme toggle functionality matching Chirpy's dark mode
- **FR-006**: System MUST transfer and display all blog post images in their correct locations
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the About page content and layout identical to the Jekyll version
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all blog post content and metadata during migration
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain URL structure for SEO and bookmark compatibility [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should URLs remain identical or is redirection acceptable?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide responsive design that works across all device sizes like the original theme

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Blog Post**: Content with title, date, categories, tags, featured image, and body content
- **Category**: Organizational grouping for posts with name, slug, and post count
- **Theme Settings**: User preferences for light/dark mode, stored locally
- **Navigation Menu**: Hierarchical structure showing categories and static pages
